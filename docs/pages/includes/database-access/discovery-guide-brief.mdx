Database discovery involves two components.

The first, the Discovery Service, is responsible for watching your cloud
provider and checking if there are any new databases or if there have been any
modifications to previously discovered databases. The second, the Database
Service, monitors the databases created by the Discovery Service. It proxies
communications between users and the database servers hosted by the cloud
provider.

In this guide, you will configure a Teleport Discovery Service to discover
{{ cloud }}-hosted databases automatically.

<Admonition type="note">
Starting from version 14, it is recommended to use the Teleport Discovery
Service for database discovery.

Please refer to the previous versions' Database Access guides for legacy
database discovery by the Database Service.
