To check that you can connect to your Teleport cluster, sign in with `tsh`, then 
verify that you can run `tctl` commands on the host using your current credentials:

{/* Ignoring scope linting since we use this partial throughout the docs and
cannot guarantee that it will line up with a page's configured scopes*/}
{/*lint ignore scopes*/} 

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="teleport.example.com" /> --user=<Var name="email@example.com" />
$ tctl status
# Cluster  (=teleport.url=)
# Version  (=teleport.version=)
# CA pin   (=presets.ca_pin=)
```

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>
If you can connect to the cluster and run the `tctl` command,
you can run subsequent `tctl` commands on the host computer.

For full privileges, you can also run `tctl` commands on your 
Teleport Auth Service host.
</ScopedBlock>

{/*lint ignore scopes*/}
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud","team"]}>
After you connect to your Teleport cluster instance, you must run subsequent `tctl` commands 
on the host computer.
</ScopedBlock>
