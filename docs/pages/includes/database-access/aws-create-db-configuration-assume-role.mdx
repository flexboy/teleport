<Details title="Want to use a different IAM role?">
By default, the Database Service authenticates with the database servers using
the IAM identity assigned to the host running it or the `assume_role_arn` field
defined in the dynamic resources.

You can add the `--aws-assume-role-arn` flag to the `teleport db configure
create` command to overwrite the IAM identity. If the role requires an external
ID, use `--aws-external-id`. The IAM identity assigned to the host must be able
to assume the specified role.
